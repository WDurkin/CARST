Cryoshpere And Remote Sensing Toolkit
-------------------------------------

The toolkit provides useful python and bash scripts that
use satellite imagery, particularly SAR and
optical images, to monitor changes of glaciers
and ice caps through time. The toolkit has two main
approaches: ice elevation changes (also known as dh/dt) 
and pixel tracking.
